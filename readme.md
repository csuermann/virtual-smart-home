      `export ALEXA_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

10. Download and install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) on your computer
11. Run the following command and note down the 'endpointAddress' for your AWS account

      `aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Data-ATS`
12. Export the value of 'endpointAddress' as an environment variable called 'IOT_ENDPOINT'

      `export IOT_ENDPOINT=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx-ats.iot.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com`
13. Create an IoT Thing Type called 'virtual-smart-home-type'

      `aws iot create-thing-type --thing-type-name "virtual-smart-home-type"`
14. Create an IoT Thing Group called 'virtual-smart-home-things'

      `aws iot create-thing-group --thing-group-name "virtual-smart-home-things"`
15. Create an IoT Billing Group called 'virtual-smart-home-billing-group'

      `aws iot create-billing-group --billing-group-name virtual-smart-home-billing-group`
16. Update the IoT index configuration

      `aws iot update-indexing-configuration --thing-indexing-configuration "thingIndexingMode=REGISTRY_AND_SHADOW, thingConnectivityIndexingMode=STATUS"`

      > NOTE: See [AWS pricing for IoT Device Management](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-device-management/pricing/). Performing this step is not strictly needed to get VSH up and running. If you do not want to enable thing indexing, consider commenting out the `metrics` endpoint in serverless.yml to prevent your CloudWatch logs from being flooded with error messages.

17. Register for an [Momento](https://www.gomomento.com/) account and export the provided token as an environment variable called 'MOMENTO_TOKEN'

    `export MOMENTO_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxx`

18. Create 2 environment variable called 'HASH_SECRET' and 'VSH_ADMIN_API_KEY' containing random strings

      `export HASH_SECRET=foobar28429789`

      `export VSH_ADMIN_API_KEY=unguessable8823472893472`

19. Create additional environment variables used by the serverless deploy process

      `export IS_PROD=false`

      `export LOG_LEVEL=debug`

      `export STRIPE_API_KEY=abc`

      `export STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=xyz`

20. run `npm install`
21. install the serverless framework by running `npm install -g serverless@3.38.0`
22. run `serverless deploy`
23. Note down the POST endpoint printed as part of the `serverless deploy` output
    - e.g. <https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/provision>
24. Run the following command and note down the 'FunctionArn'

      `aws lambda get-function --function-name virtual-smart-home-dev-skill`
25. In the Alexa Developer Console click on 'Smart Home' in the side menu
26. Paste the value of the FunctionArn (from step 24) as 'Default Endpoint' as well as for 'Europe / India'
27. Click Save
28. Your own backend should now be set up! Congratulations!

## Configuring Node-RED

Now you need to configure your Node-RED vsh-connection node to use _your_ backend instead of the official one.

1. Open the `settings.js` file of your Node-RED installation and add the following just before the closing "}"

    ```javascript
    vshConnectionShowSettings: true,
    ```

2. Restart Node-RED
3. Create a new vsh node and chose 'add new vsh-connection' from the connection dropdown
4. Replace the 'Backend URL' with the value you noted down in step 23, BUT WITHOUT THE trailing '/provision' !!!
5. Replace 'LWA Client ID' with the value you noted down as 'Client Id' in step 6.12
6. Click 'Add'
7. Come back to the previous page by clicking the pen-icon
8. Follow the account linking instructions, which should now go against your own backend

## Testing that everything works

1. Activate your skill in the Alexa app and complete the Account Linking process (your skill should show up under 'Your skills > Developer')
2. In your AWS account, check the CloudWatch log group '/aws/lambda/virtual-smart-home-dev-skill'. It should contain an "AcceptGrant" request from Alexa and a corresponding response.
3. Open your Node-RED frontend
4. Add a new 'virtual device' to your flow and name it 'foo bar'
5. Open the Developer Tools' network tab
6. Double click on your virtual 'foo bar' device to open the editor
7. Follow the instructions above to configure the vsh-connection to interact with your own backend
8. Observe the activity on the DevTools network tab
      - the call to 'check_version' should go out to your own backend URL
      - the request payload to '<https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/create/codepair>' should include the 'client_id' of the security profile you configured earlier
9. Complete the code pairing process
10. Activate the 'Debug' option of the vsh-connection node
11. Deploy your Node-RED flow
12. Your virtual 'foo bar' device should now get discovered by Alexa.
13. Check the MQTT traffic being logged to stdout of Node-RED
14. Go to the [IoT section](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home?region=eu-west-1#/thinghub) in your AWS account and click on 'Manage > Things' in the side menu
      - The list should contain one 'Thing' representing your configured vsh-connection
15. Click on the thing and inspect its shadow document that hold the configurations of your devices
16. Click on the 'Activity' menu item and observe shadow changes when you connect / disconnect your connection (e.g. by restarting Node-RED)

## Enable PRO features

1. [Navigate](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodbv2/home?region=eu-west-1#item-explorer?table=VSH&maximize=true) to your DynamoDB
2. Find and edit the item with SK 'TOKEN'
3. Add a new attribute 'plan' of type 'string' with the value 'pro'
4. Save the changes
5. Restart Node-RED so that the changes get picked up.
